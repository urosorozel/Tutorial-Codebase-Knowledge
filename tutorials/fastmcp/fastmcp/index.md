# Tutorial: fastmcp

**FastMCP** is a software framework designed to facilitate the integration
and management of various components such as **tools, resources, and prompts**
within a server environment. It acts as a central **hub**, enabling seamless
communication between clients and servers, **leveraging** protocols like OpenAPI
and offering flexible configuration settings for dynamic and complex workflows.
